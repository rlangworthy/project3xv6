uv2p(3)

NAME
	uv2p -- translate virtal address to physical address

SYNOPSIS
	#include "user.h"

	char*
	uv2p(char*);

DESCRIPTION
	uv2p takes a single pointer cast to char* and returns its location in 
	physical memory, also cast to a char*.  The char* cast is to bring uv2p in
	to agreement with sbrk, the only other syscall that returns a pointer.

RETURN VALUES
	Upon successful completion it returns a pointer to the argument's location
	 in physical memory.  It returns -1 for values outside process memory and
	0 for values within the bounds of process memory but not currently in 
	physical memory.
